## Vision Statement

> "YAMLLM aims to be the most developer-friendly, performant, and extensible YAML-based LLM orchestration library."

**Status:** In Progress - Strong foundation laid, key features being refined

---

## Core Promises Status

### 1. Effortless Onboarding (10-20 lines to chat)

**Manifesto Promise:**
> "Get from zero to chat in 10-20 lines of code"

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **Partial** (40% Complete)

**What Works:**
```python
from yamllm import OpenAIGPT
import os

llm = OpenAIGPT(config_path="config.yaml", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
response = llm.query("Hello!")
```

**Gaps:**
- Requires creating a YAML config file first (not counted in "lines of code")
- No default config option for truly quick start
- Setup complexity for tools and memory

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add `LLM.from_defaults()` factory method
- [ ] Ship sensible default config in package
- [ ] Add `yamllm init` CLI command to generate config

**Target:** v1.0
