## Critical Issues Identified

### Priority 0 (Must Fix)

1. **Documentation Inaccuracies**
   - README references non-existent `yamllm-core` PyPI package
   - Installation instructions incorrect
   - Only lists 4 tools instead of 22
   - Missing CLI debugging documentation

2. **Code Complexity**
   - Main `LLM` class: 1,548 lines (violates Single Responsibility Principle)
   - Needs decomposition into smaller, focused classes

3. **Architecture Duplication**
   - Separate `LLM` and `AsyncLLM` classes with significant duplication
   - Dual `ToolManager` concepts causing confusion

4. **Missing Critical Tests**
   - No tests for `_filter_tools_for_prompt()` (136-line function)
   - No tests for `_determine_tool_choice()`
   - No CLI integration tests
   - Limited MCP edge case coverage

### Priority 1 (Important)

1. **Performance Gaps**
   - Embedding cache limited to 64 entries
   - Tool definitions regenerated on every request
   - No connection pooling
   - No performance monitoring

2. **Error Handling**
   - Inconsistent error handling across providers
   - Library code uses `print()` instead of `logging`
   - No structured logging

3. **Tool Routing Reliability**
   - Tool selection can be unreliable
   - No deterministic tool gating tests

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)

1. **CLI Improvements**
   - Monolithic 800+ line file
   - Needs modularization

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - No rate limiting
   - Limited tool parameter validation
   - No audit logging

3. **Unused Dependencies**
   - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` in optional deps

## Manifesto Alignment Analysis

The project has a clear manifesto with ambitious goals. Current implementation status:

| Manifesto Promise | Status | Gap |
|-------------------|--------|-----|
| 10-20 lines to chat | ⚠️ Partial | Requires complex config currently |
| Beautiful terminal output | ❌ Missing | No Rich themes, no streaming UI |
| Async everywhere | ⚠️ Partial | Sync/async duplication issues |
| First token < 350ms | ❌ Not measured | No optimization or monitoring |
| MCP first-class | ⚠️ Buggy | Async implementation issues |
| Developer tools | ✅ Good | 22 tools, extensible |
| Thinking in the open | ⚠️ Partial | Not wired in examples |
| Memory & logging | ✅ Good | SQLite + FAISS working |
| YAML configuration | ✅ Excellent | Pydantic validation |
| Provider agnostic | ✅ Excellent | 8+ providers |

**Overall Manifesto Completion: ~60%**

## Strengths to Preserve

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Clear separation: `core/`, `providers/`, `tools/`, `memory/`, `ui/`
   - Well-designed abstractions
   - Factory patterns for provider instantiation

2. **Comprehensive Provider Support**
   - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek, Azure, OpenRouter
   - Unified interface through `BaseProvider`
   - Consistent tool calling

3. **Rich Tooling**
   - 22 built-in tools covering diverse needs
   - Thread-safe execution
   - Security controls (path restrictions, domain blocking)
   - Extensible architecture

4. **Quality Development Practices**
   - Comprehensive type hints (95%+)
   - Good docstring coverage
   - 28 test files with good provider coverage
   - Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer)

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Pydantic-based validation
   - Environment variable substitution
   - Hierarchical config with sensible defaults
