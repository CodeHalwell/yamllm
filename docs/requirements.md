# YAMLLM Project Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the key requirements, goals, and constraints for the YAMLLM project, a Python library for YAML-based LLM configuration and execution.

## Core Goals

1. **Simplify LLM Integration**
   - Provide a unified interface for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, MistralAI)
   - Abstract away provider-specific implementation details
   - Enable easy switching between different LLM providers

2. **Configuration-Driven Development**
   - Use YAML files as the primary configuration mechanism
   - Allow users to store base settings and experiment without changing Python code
   - Support comprehensive configuration options for all aspects of LLM interaction

3. **User Experience**
   - Provide a simple, intuitive API for developers
   - Offer clear, helpful error messages and documentation
   - Implement CLI interactions that are easy to use via the rich library
   - Format code snippets and responses in markdown for readability

4. **Memory Management**
   - Implement conversation history tracking
   - Provide vector database integration for semantic search
   - Support both short-term and long-term memory capabilities

## Functional Requirements

1. **LLM Provider Support**
   - Support for OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
   - Support for Google models (Gemini)
   - Support for DeepSeek models
   - Support for MistralAI models
   - Extensible architecture for adding new providers

2. **Configuration System**
   - YAML-based configuration files
   - Environment variable support for sensitive data
   - Comprehensive settings for model parameters, request handling, context management, etc.
   - Validation of configuration options

3. **Conversation Management**
   - System prompt customization
   - Conversation history tracking
   - Context window management
   - Session management

4. **Tool Integration**
   - Calculator for arithmetic operations
   - Web Search for retrieving up-to-date information
   - Weather for current conditions and forecasts
   - Web Scraper for extracting data from websites
   - Extensible framework for adding new tools

5. **Output Handling**
   - Support for different output formats (text, JSON, markdown)
   - Streaming and non-streaming response options
   - Rich formatting for console output

6. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error detection and reporting
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

7. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Configurable logging levels and formats
   - Log file management
   - Performance monitoring

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Efficient handling of requests and responses
   - Minimal overhead compared to direct API calls
   - Optimized memory usage for conversation history

2. **Reliability**
   - Robust error handling
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

3. **Security**
   - Secure handling of API keys
   - Content filtering options
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Protection against sensitive information leakage

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clean, well-documented code following PEP 8 guidelines
   - Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
   - Type hints for improved code understanding
   - Modular architecture for easy extension

5. **Usability**
   - Clear, comprehensive documentation
   - Intuitive API design
   - Helpful error messages
   - Example code for common use cases

## Constraints

1. **Technical Constraints**
   - Python 3.8+ compatibility
   - Minimal external dependencies
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

2. **Legal Constraints**
   - MIT License
   - Compliance with LLM provider terms of service
   - Proper attribution for third-party libraries

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Reasonable CPU utilization
   - Consideration for API rate limits and costs

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional LLM Providers**
   - Support for more LLM providers as they become available
   - Integration with open-source models

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Fine-tuning support
   - More sophisticated memory management
   - Advanced prompt engineering tools
   - Integration with other AI services

3. **Ecosystem Expansion**
   - Web interface or GUI
   - Integration with popular frameworks
   - Plugin system for community extensions
